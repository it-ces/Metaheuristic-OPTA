# Metaheuristic-OPTA
"This repo contain information and implementation of some metaheuristics"



# TSP (Traveling Salmesman Problem) was elected to test how works metaheuristics in the problem

# The following algorithms are avalaible:
* Genetic algorithm using deap
* Simulated annealing from scratch
